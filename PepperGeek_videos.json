These two techniques are great for creating an easier-to-manage pepper garden that is also more attractive.\n\nMulching peppers is a great way to prevent weeds, reduce soil splashing and insulating the roots from the cold. We love using straw, but it can be a bit messy. You can also use grass clippings, black plastic, or wood chips (though you should use some caution with these).\n\nBottom pruning is optional, but definitely worth considering for its benefits. The goal is to remove lower foliage (but not low branches) from the plant, up to about 6\" above the soil. This helps avoid soil hitting the leaves, and makes it much easier to access the plant for watering and harvesting.\n\nJoin our Patreon to grow peppers with us!\n‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ https://patreon.com/peppergeek\n\nüå∂Ô∏è HOW TO GROW PEPPERS \nhttps://peppergeek.com/how-to-grow-peppers\n\nüì∏ INSTAGRAM\nhttps://www.instagram.com/peppergeek\n\n*****************************************\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:37 - About bottom pruning\n1:50 - How to bottom prune peppers\n4:35 - About mulching\n6:22 - How to mulch peppers\n\n*****************************************\nThanks for watching Pepper Geek!\n#peppers #pruning #mulching #gardening #growing"

        "description": "Staking peppers is important to prevent wind damage. As the pepper plants grow taller, they become more susceptible to strong winds. Broken branches and even knocked over plants are possible if you don't provide a sturdy stake.\n\nAlso, attaching the plant to the stake at multiple points is important to ensure that each part of the plant has the support it needs. As your plants begin to fruit, the peppers can weigh on the branches, potentially causing damage if left unsupported.\n\nSo in this video, we show our simple method for staking peppers and discuss the various pepper species and how they need to be supported.\n\nChinense peppers require the most support, especially when grown in large pots. They can be huge and bushy with many large branches, benefiting from a tomato-cage-like support system.\n\nAnnuum peppers usually need just one central stake, while baccatum and pubescens grow tall and slender, requiring a tall, central stake for support.\n\nSupport us:\nhttps://peppergeek.com/support-us\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/peppergeek\n\n************************************\nProducts (affiliate links):\nVelcro:\nhttps://amzn.to/34AILgh\n\nBamboo stakes (large):\nhttps://fave.co/3bZaThm\n\n************************************\nRead more on staking:\nhttps://peppergeek.com/staking-pepper-plants\n\n************************************\n\nThanks for watching Pepper Geek!\n\n#peppers #gardening #tips #staking"

If you're hoping to grow your own red/yellow striped bell peppers, think again.\n\nThe peppers were grown during a \"screening trial of mutants\" of a pepper variety. The result is a plant that is being repeatedly cloned to produce more of the striped peppers. In other words, all of these peppers (likely) come from a single organism!\n\nIn any case, this pepper is COOL. I wish we could crossbreed the striped pattern into other Capsicum annuum varieties, but alas, we (probably) cannot.\n\nUPDATE: We tasted this pepper and it is DELICIOUS. Sweet and crunchy, like a yellow bell pepper.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I don't actually know how this pepper was created, we're just speculating for the most part! It is interesting that the seeds don't produce true-to-form pepper pods when grown, but the exact process used to achieve this variety is unknown.\n\nRead more:\nhttps://the-biologist-is-in.blogspot.com/2017/02/biology-of-enjoya-pepper.html\n\nHope you enjoy :)\n\n#peppers #gardening #aloha #enjoya"
